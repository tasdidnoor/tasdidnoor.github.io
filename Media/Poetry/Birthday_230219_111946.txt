I had a lot of friends
Or atleast that's what I thought they were
"We'll always be there for you" they said
I smiled and believed that they care

I still wake up at the middle of the night
Hearing notification on my phone
I wish it's one of my friends
But the reality hits me and leaves me all alone

Maybe they weren’t actually my friends
All the love and care, it was part of a big lie
Im still lying on my bed
Just trying to get by

Or maybe i pushed them away?
Just like i always do
I still wish they stayed
I still wish they knew

One of them stayed though
8 years and she still got my back
Trying to be better for her
Trying to give her what we lack

She looks like the sun
Shines brighter and brighter everyday
I still want to hold her hand
And tell her that it's gonna be okay

I'm sure i'm gonna see her in a crown
The crown we always talked about
She's gonna achieve everything
I dont even have one single doubt
 
We'll make it through
I'll love her more than I could
She still thinks i'm happy
I still hope she's good
