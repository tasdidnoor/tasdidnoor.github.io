I dont regret giving you that part of me
But I wished you would just see

How I held your hand and looked you in the eyes
How I talked with you and said our goodbyes

I dont regret giving you that part of my soul
I wanted to give you my heart in a whole

I wanted to give you a lot more
I wanted to tell you how you can stop swimming as we reached the shore

I still dont regret giving you everything i had
I will be lying if I said I wasnt sad

I thought we had it
I thought you were the one waiting for me
Its funny how I still believe that
I still dont want to disagree

Maybe you'll come back someday
Would it be too late though?
Would I still be waiting?
Or maybe I'll just go.
