I want to escape my mind,
I tried my best
but it all feels like a rewind.
what would it feel like to 
Have no sorrows to hold on to
Not living in someone else' grace
Just me and myself
with that little smile on my face
All of it inside of me
eating me away in agony
was it really worth it?
asking myself everytime i fall

Need to find a way to let it all out
But im in the maze
I come back and forth
with the lights out
when there's a will
theres a way
but im coming
back in daze of sway
controlling and killing me
each time i smile
i know its not my spree
so i show my real side
i surrender
so at last i'll be remembered
