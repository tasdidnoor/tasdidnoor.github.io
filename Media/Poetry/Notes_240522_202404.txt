Its been an eternity, life's going downhill
Stumbled upon that same old feeling
Wrapped with her scent still

I left my old self with her
Seems like she did the same
She was sent from paradise
Bound by someone 
who'd never witness the same

Love turned to envy
Admiration turned into competition
She's turned into everything I wanna be
Everything i dream to become

Everyone admires her
She's something hard to tame
She wasn't this person before
Not atleast the same
