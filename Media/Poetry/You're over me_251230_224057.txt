The year clocked back
Back to that familiar time
Bringing back all those repressed memories
The ones that I thought i could never rhyme

The ones that I tried to keep burried deep
Deeper than that scar
The scar that you curved in my heart
when you left to become a star

You always loved her
As you should
Afterall its your ownself
The one that I love and always would

You seem happy now
Your laugh's still the loudest in the room
You're trying to be better
Trying to once again just bloom

Your voice sounded annoying last Friday
Is this how it feels to move on?
Is this how you felt?
When you asked me to be gone.

It's been hard, the past couple of months
I started loving sleep
Just so i could meet you again
In my dreams
