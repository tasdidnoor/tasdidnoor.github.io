She was my world
i called her my queen
it meant nothing
i called her my world
it meant nothing

Maybe it is funny
i daydreamed when i shouldve slept
i thought we might have it
but it was too much for her to take in
i gave her everything anyway and she just played with it

What went wrong?
was it my fault?
or was it hers?
no one to blame here
i would rather blame me.

she made me love stuffs i couldnt have ever loved
she showed me the meaning
she showed me the purpose
i cant help but be thankful
maybe i'll just stand here waiting

would it be worth it?
should i leave?
or should i stay?
she said she isnt mad at me
i can sense her lies
i can hear her cries
what did i do wrong?
why did i do wrong?
