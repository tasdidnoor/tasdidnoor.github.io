what was all that for?

My life's flashing before my eyes
i can understand her reason
i can feel her agony
it really was her prison

What did i do wrong?
I made them smile
I made them laugh
But eventually
They left my heart in a broken half

Even if i die right now
Would i have any regret?
Would they ask if i did enough?
Or are they just gonna forget? 

I was a pathetic wreck
Made all the possible mistakes
Bit the apple
Got surrounded by some snakes.

Im gasping for air now
Why is it becoming so hard
I still have a lot to do
I still have a lot to guard

The pain's easing out now
I see her standing there
Her arms are wide open
I try to run to her 
And suddenly feel awaken

Maybe thats what death is
Going back to her abundance
Trying to start a new chapter 
Trying to seek her indulgence
