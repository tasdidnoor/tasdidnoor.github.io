Here I am again
Back to square one
Still waiting for another chance
But she knows that she'd never give me one

It all seemed so perfect 
Until it wasnt anymore
We seemed so perfect for each other
Till we weren't anymore

I still wanna go to the gardens, the lake, the library, the concert
Want her head resting on my shoulder
Her head lying on my lap
Her hands curled up with mine
Her eyes having the perfect shine

It's not gonna happen ever again
She'd go to the same place
But with somebody else this time
That person wont make her uncomfortable
Rather give her the space she wants

I just hope she gets loved more than I ever loved her
She deserves it
She deserves the whole world
I know she got this
And it's all gonna be earned

She's just like that
She can do anything she wants
I'm so proud of her
She'd be happier
More than we ever were

I'd be lying if i say I'm not upset
It's gonna be hard for me
I'd keep thinking bout everything she did
Every single things she gave to me

Maybe that's what I'd hold onto
The bracelet and it's charm
The letter and her smell
The rocks, the books and everything else that made me fell

I'm afraid I'd ever be able to love someone this much in my life
I'm afraid whether my hands would go behind that person's chair just to save her
I'm afraid I'd ever look into someone's eyes and try to find out their eye colour
I'm afraid I'd ever do anything and everything that I did for her

Would I be able to give flowers to that person everyday?
Would I lie on her knee and feel okay?
Would we be comfortable in silence 
Or was it just between you and me or was it all fake?

I'm still gonna try to look at you during practices
I'll still look at your bus stop while passing on my bus
I'll still look around the main hallway just to see that familiar face
This time there wont be that same smile that I crave for
There would be this disgust that you never felt

I still want to hug you
Nd i want to promise that I wont let go
You'd feel my hands on your back
And know that I'll always love you

I dont know how to stop these tears from falling down
I dont know when to stop
I still dont know what no means
It's always been the same and it's always been my fault

My mother still thinks you're making me a better person
Little does she know that you're long gone to turn back
Why did I mess up this bad
You were the best part of me and everything i ever lack

Would you ever give me another chance?
Or am i just hoping, looking at a dead end?
I still want to be there when you want to cry your heart out
I want you to be there when I cry myself

I'm always stuck without the answer of ''what did i do''
But this time you gave me the answer and I still hope you just knew
How none of this is the real me
I never meant to hurt you intentionally
I'm the guy who looks at you the way he never looked at anyone else
I'm the guy who waits for you outside of your class with a flower in his hand

Im not a bad person moonlight
I did bad things
Nd i regret it
I still hope I can take it all back
Cause I dont know where to go without you
What to do without you
I'm stuck in this never ending loop 
Just waiting for you to come back

You told me to ''Just accept it''
I shouldve just accepted it
I still dont get it how it's this easy for you to let go
Where I'm dying to make my heart blow

I loved you
I did long before you ever knew me
And I'll always will long after you'll forget me

I dont know if you'd feel the same way
Or you'd be fine
I want you to be fine
I always wanted you to shine

I know how much of an awful person I am
You know it now too
I dont want anyone else to love you
I just want it to be me
And you

I couldnt write even half of what I wanted to
Maybe someday I will
I still dont know when that someday will come though 
I would be waiting till

Here I am again
Back to square one
Still waiting for you to forgive me
But you seem like to be gone
