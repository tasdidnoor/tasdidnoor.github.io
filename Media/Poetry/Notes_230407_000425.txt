I had a good sleep last night
Thinking about all the things she said
How im her type of person and
How i'll be the one to hold her hand instead

I am far from home
Home that im familiar to stay at
I found another one though
She feels like the home i want to stay at

I still have a lot to say to her
Everything what i like about her
Her smile, her laugh, her accent
And how i'll always be the same person i were

I still think bout her 
Everytime i look at the moon
The way she shines when no one else can
The way she blooms like June

I fell for her again
Harder than before
I still cant help it
I still cant reach the shore

I'm still gonna look at her
Looking like the fool i am
She's gonna smile and i'm gonna die
Die like the fool i am

No one makes me feel the way she does
Everything she says and everything she shares
I wanna hear it all
I wanna tell her that there's somebody who cares

I never believed in soulmates before
Until i met her
I wanna go home too
I kinda wanna also go to hers

I wanna tell her everything about myself
I wanna show her my world
Atleast she wont leave me like everyone else did
Or atleast she wont make me think that my head is whirled

I feel so safe around her
She feels like home
I wanna go to all the places she desires to go to
Just to roam and roam

She's such a heart stealer
Anyone would fall flat
I would lie if I said im not jealous
But she's just like that

She's the most interesting person ive ever talked to
She's the strongest girl ive ever seen
She has come so far
I just cant help but call her the queen

How can someone be this perfect
How can someone have eyes this perfect shades of blue
Im still gonna sleep good tonight
Knowing that she'll sleep good too
