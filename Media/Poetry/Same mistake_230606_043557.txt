I'm doing the same mistake
I'm getting stuck in the maze
I know it's not gonna lasr forever
But i cant still seem to lower my gaze

She said, she doesnt feel a thing
when she needs to let go
I fear its gonna be me next
I fear i'd have to go

I've got attachment issues i said
She didnt seem to care
She kept telling me how she left her friends
I know its gonna be hard for me to bear

I'll still give her everything i have though
I dont want her go through those again
I'll give her all the springs and autumns
I'll give her the moon and the rain

We'll go to bluffs 
I'll bring her some paints
She'll paint some rocks

I'll look at her eyes for a while
I'll tell her how it's the perfect mixture
Of blue and green
She'll know by looking at me that
That's the happiest me she's ever seen
