I walked through that door 
More confident than I ever was
My palms were a bit sweaty
I knew i will regret this

I didnt care though
I wanted to fall for her
I knew she was the one
It seemed so easy

No one ever looked at me
The way she did
I wanted more of it
Everyday, every night
I wanted more of it

I planned what we'll name our daughter 
I wished she would look just like her mother
Intelligent, beautiful and kind
We both would love her more than the whole world

But it was all a dream
Part of a big lie
I'm getting out of the same door now
More heartbroken than i ever was

It took me 3months to lover her
It took her 3days to make me regret it
I thought the reason was silly
She was being too sensitive 

Or maybe i was just being too into it?
It happened so fast
Just one night
Nd we were done

I didnt know ive got attachment issues
Was it really love
Or just a mistake?
I might never find out

But it felt different 
It felt real
I thought we might have it
God, im pathetic 

I still want to say her those 
3 words and 8 letters
But it seems so funny now
She doesnt seem to know me anymore

We try to avoid each other
She has her own reasons
I have my own humiliations

I never got to say goodbye
It felt so good for the moment
Never knew the aftertaste would be this important 

I still love her though
I dont have any hard feelings
I never had any
I still find myself trying to look for her every now and then

Never found her
She's lost
And long gone
Happier than ever

I wish she is happy
I wish she is great
I wish she finds someone new
I wish she loves someone new
I wish she forgets me
I wish she forgives me
I wish i never see her again
I wish she is happier.
