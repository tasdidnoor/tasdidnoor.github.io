I met her on my first day of school
She was looking at the board
I was looking at her like a fool

She looked like the sun
Shone brighter and brighter everyday
I wanted to hold her hand
And tell her that it's gonna be okay

She loved her country
She loved playing chess
She loved poetry
My love seemed too little to confess

I started loving my country
I started liking playing chess
I started loving poetry
Yet my love seemed too little to express

We stayed awake till midnight
Woke up to each other's text
I thought this was it
She is gonna be the next

I called her my queen
I started planning our prom
I told her i respect her
She told me she loved my mom

I read a whole book
Just so i could talk with her the other day
She was mad at me for some reason
I didnt know what to say

She said i didnt respect her boundary 
She said i didnt know when to stop
She said i didnt know what 'no' means
I just stood there and let my heart drop

It was my fault all along
I pushed her away
I wanted to say i loved her
I wanted so much more to say

I have this super power
I can make everyone leave
I kinda wish i didnt have it
I kinda wished i wasnt this naive

Here I am again
Back to square one
Still waiting for her to forgive me
But she seems like to be gone

God I loved her
She was perfect
She was more than beautiful
She still looks at that board
I still look at her like a fool
