I had a lot of friends
Or atleast that's what I thought they were
"We'll always be there for you" they said
I smiled and believed that they care

It's been more than 6 months now
Only got calls from two
They think i'm more than happy
But i want them to know that its not true

I still wake up at the middle of the night
Hearing notification on my phone
I wish it's one of my friends
But the reality hits me and leaves me all alone

Maybe they weren’t actually my friends
All the love and care, it was part of a big lie
Im still lying on my bed
Just trying to get by

I was popular for some reason
People knew me even If i didnt know them
It felt good, all the attention, all the respect
Until I found out that they just knew how to condemn

Or maybe i pushed them away?
Just like i always do
I still wish they stayed
I still wish they knew

One of them stayed though
8 years and she still got my back
Trying to be better for her
Trying to give her what we lack

 
We'll make it through
I'll love her more than I could
She still thinks i'm happy
I still hope she's good
