                            <h3>Soulpepper City Youth Academy (2024)</h3>
                            <p>The Diner (2024) is an ensemble piece performed in 2024 at Soulpepper Theatre Academy as part of their City Youth Academy program. The play weaves together the lives of ten individuals, each grappling with their own struggles, dreams, and connections within the confines of a small-town diner.</p>
                            <p>In The Diner, I portrayed the character of a father navigating the emotional burden of a divorce and the possibility of losing custody of his daughter. My character's journey was one of vulnerability and resilience.</p>
                            <p>The ensemble of ten actors explored interconnected stories, each character adding depth to the play. The collaborative nature of the ensemble helped me to explore the shared human experience, emphasizing how our stories, though unique, are often intertwined.</p>
                            <p>Playing the father in The Diner was a deeply rewarding experience, allowing me to explore the complexities of parenthood, vulnerability, and hope. The ensemble's collective energy and the diner's intimate setting created a powerful atmosphere.</p>

                            <h3>NTV Utsho (2016)</h3>
                            <p>NTV Utsho (2016) was a widely loved Bangladeshi soap opera that aired on NTV, known for its emotional storytelling and relatable family drama. I had the opportunity to appear in one of its episodes as the 8-year-old son of the protagonist, a child caught in the middle of his parents' struggles.</p>
                            <p>The episode centered on a family battling poverty, with my character's father overwhelmed by work stress and taking out his frustrations on my mother. I portrayed a sensitive, mature-beyond-his-years boy who silently witnessed their conflicts, torn between love for both parents. In a pivotal scene, I confronted my father, calling out his unfair treatment of my mother- a moment that became a turning point, making him reflect on his actions.</p>
                            <p>Working on NTV Utsho was a powerful experience, allowing me to explore the emotional weight of a child navigating adult hardships. The role demanded a balance of innocence and quiet wisdom, showing how children often understand more than adults realize. The rawness of the storyline and the realism of the characters made it resonate deeply with viewers, many of whom saw their own struggles reflected in the narrative.</p>
                            <p>Being part of such a beloved series taught me the impact of storytelling in portraying real-life struggles. Even as a young actor, I felt the responsibility of bringing authenticity to my role, hoping to make the audience feel both the pain and the hope within the family's journey.</p>

                            <p>Fame(2023) comments on 1950-80s show business and the price an individual often had to pay in order to gain fame and fortune.</p>
                            <p>In the foreground of Fame stands a figure amidst an ocean of book pages. These pages symbolize the negative commentary that often surrounds individuals striving for success in the world of entertainment. The vibrant skies encircling the figure's head represent their thoughts and creative talents, juxtaposed against the challenges faced within the competitive show industry. Judgemental eyes rip through the midground, conveying the gaze of society and how it scrutinizes those who pursue creative pathways. The figure in Fame stands firmly in front of the composition, conveying its desire to put the negativity associated with show business behind it, as it steps forward into a more optimistic future.</p>
                            <p>In the background, there are black and white images of past celebrities who have achieved fame in their lifetime. The black censor bars that cover their eyes signifies the cost of this fame and what they may have lost in exchange. Often, when an individual achieves high levels of success in the entertainment industry, it comes with a loss of privacy. Celebrities are also constantly under the scrutiny of the public eye, which watches their every move for the slightest slip up. When pursuing creative passions, a person is frequently judged for following a "pipedream", yet once they achieve a modicum of success, they must face other pressures that come with working in the field.</p>

                            <h3>Arduino Auto-Plant Watering System</h3>
                            <p><strong>Language:</strong> MATLAB</p>
                            <p><strong>Year:</strong> 2025</p>
                            <p>This project explores the development of an automated plant-watering system using MATLAB and the Grove Beginner Kit for Arduino to demonstrate reactive control through a state-machine-based design.</p>
                            <p>The primary objectives were to monitor soil moisture for a period of time and control a water pump in fixed bursts based on sensor feedback, integrate an additional sensor beyond the required components, and implement a manual emergency stop.</p>
                            <p>The system was structured as a finite-state machine with dry-soil watering, and wet-soil idling, while incorporating an eCO₂ sensor as the additional hardware component to modify watering duration under elevated indoor air-quality conditions.</p>
                            <p>MATLAB was used to read analog moisture values, convert them into dryness percentages, graph the values live, and run the pump through a MOSFET board in five-second bursts with mandatory pauses. A button on the Grove board functioned as an emergency stop, ensuring safety.</p>
                            <p>The system reliably detected transitions between dry and wet soil, activated the pump only during appropriate states, and produced clear real-time graphical output corresponding to moisture changes. Incorporating the eCO₂ sensor successfully altered watering duration under simulated high-CO₂ conditions, and the emergency stop halted operation immediately.</p>
                            <p>The project successfully demonstrated a robust state-machine implementation for autonomous plant maintenance using MATLAB, sensors, and embedded hardware. Future improvements could include data logging, wireless communication, or a more sophisticated moisture-prediction model to further enhance autonomy and system intelligence.</p>

                            <h3>Home Front (2024)</h3>
                            <p>Home Front (2024) responds to the systematic destruction of the Holocaust, with a specific focus on the obliteration of the home as the primary vessel for personal history, identity, and memory.</p>
                            <p>The central form of Home Front is a fractured domestic facade, rendered in fragile, fired clay. This material choice underscores the vulnerability of human sanctuary. The bombed-out windows and shattered walls are not merely structural damage; they are voids where life once pulsed. These absences symbolize the brutal erasure of everyday rituals, whispered conversations, and the accumulated warmth of generations—all annihilated in an instant of targeted violence. The piece stands as a stark, silent witness to the countless homes reduced to rubble, each one a universe of stories extinguished.</p>
                            <p>The textural surface of the clay, marked by intentional cracks and rough, unfinished edges, speaks to the trauma inflicted not only on brick and mortar but on the very concept of safety. The scale of the piece, intimate enough to hold, forces a confrontation with the personal magnitude of such loss, countering the abstract, statistical horror of historical atrocity. It insists that we comprehend the Holocaust not only in camps and cattle cars but in the smoldering wreckage of a childhood bedroom, a kitchen table buried under beams, a family portrait swallowed by dust.</p>
                            <p>This work contends that to destroy a home is to attack the future as much as the past. It severs the physical lineage where heirlooms are passed down and where family narratives are nurtured. Home Front serves as a memorial for these lost domestic archives. It asks the viewer to consider what fragments they would clutch if their own world was shattered, and to remember that behind every historical headline of destruction lies an irreplaceable, intimate world, now silent.</p>
